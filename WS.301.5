Definition of Done
Definition	Done should include everything we need to do for all items in this increment release, including user acceptance testing.
Purpose	The definition of ‘done’ is a well-understood and clearly documented definition of items that must be established to mark a story (or iteration or project) to be complete. Getting a story to a completed state per the definition of done should be the goal of a team and should be used as the basis for planning.


Product Backlog
Definition	The Product Backlog is used to document the wants and needs for “stuff,” which is prioritized by how much value it is to the business.
Purpose	•	Different people in the business will ask for different “stuff.”
•	Not everything that is asked for has value to the business.
•	Some things may be valuable only to the person asking rather than to the entire business.
•	By prioritizing value to the business, non-value add or less-value add items are eliminated or moved to the bottom of the list.
•	The list is worked based on what the highest priority or value is to the business.

Ordering	The Product Backlog is an ordered list of "requirements" that is maintained for a product. It contains Product Backlog Items that are ordered by the Product Owner based on considerations like risk, business value, dependencies, date needed, etc. The features added to the backlog are commonly written in story format (See terminology below). The product backlog is the “What” that will be built, sorted in the relative order it should be built in. It is open and editable by anyone, but the Product Owner is ultimately responsible for ordering the stories on the backlog for the Development Team.
The Product Backlog, and business value of each listed item is the responsibility of the Product Owner. The estimated effort to complete each backlog item is, however, determined by the Development Team. The team contributes by estimating Items and User-Stories, either in Story-points or in estimated hours

Product Backlog  Grooming	•	Product Backlog is constantly re-evaluated and re-ordered, and items added or removed in a process are called Product Backlog Grooming.

Large Items	•	Very large PBIs are called Epics.
PBIs	•	Product Backlog is constantly re-evaluated and re-ordered, and items added or removed in a process are called Product Backlog Grooming.



Sprint Backlog
Definition	The Sprint Backlog is the list of work the Development Team must address during the next sprint
Purpose	Focus on the added value to the customer, not (just) the product!
Source of items	Chosen based on the estimated amount of work required to complete.
How are items chosen?	Chosen by the development team, from the highest priority value.
What does value
orientation vs. results orientation mean?	Focuses more on quality of product vs. how much is completed in a short amount of time.
Task Board	Tasks are tracked progressively to completion, and re-evaluated e very day during the daily standup.
Sprint Backlog Item	Only pull into sprint backlog the amount of work that the team believes they can reasonably accomplish successfully.


Once chosen, the Sprint Backlog list is frozen — “nothing can be added” until this list is completed in the next time-box.



 Burndown Chart
Purpose	The Burn-down chart provides a daily measure of work remaining in an iteration.
How is it updated?	Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference
How often is
it used?	Daily
Significance?	The sprint Burn-down chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.
User Stories

Definition	Describes what the user needs to do in the job function.
Purpose	Used a basis for requirements gathering.
Format	Name
Brief narrative
Acceptance criteria
Any defined conditions
Source	User
Attributes for completeness	Completes criteria in conditions

Estimation

Story Points 	Choosing enough work to fill up a full sprint:
•	Based on relative effort.
•	Show only the relative size of the item - not the time to complete.
•	Teams pick a simple, agreed-upon basis.

Used for Estimation Activities.

Planning Poker	Determining the amount of work for each
Product Backlog Item

Based on the Fibonacci Sequence:
•	Each numbered card represents the amount of work the team member believes this item represents.
•	Each development team member is issued one set of cards.
•	If, when hands are shown, there is not a clear agreement on the amount of work involved, high and low bidders will explain why they chose that bid.
•	The team will revote until they reach a consensus.
Fibonacci
Sequence	The Fibonacci sequence is a type of series where each number is the sum of the two that precede it.  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
